# This makefile is designed to allow compilation and packaging of the CST1B Java ticks.
# Rename it to `makefile` and put it in the directory outside of your uk/ folder
#
# Usage: make [option] TICK=tickX ENTRY=ClassName INCLUDE=Something.jar CRSID=spqr23
#
# For additional clarification, ENTRY should be set to the name of the class containing
# your program's main entry point (i.e. public static void main(String[] args))
#
# Some of the parameters are optional.  E.g. ENTRY is only used for `package`
#
# By changing these declarations at the head of the file, you can change the default
# values for the named options should you choose to omit them.  The CRSID declaration
# is left in as an example.
